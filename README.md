# CSE 351: Data Science Assignment 2
Done for homework by myself.

## Source
AB_NYC_2019.csv NYC AirBnB data from 2019

## Overview
My goal was to statistically analyze data on NYC's AirBnBs to find patterns.
First, I cleaned the data by removing unrealistic / nonsensical entries and outliers as well as entries with empty fields, and created a plot of the mean prices in each neighborhood. Then, I created a pairwise correlation matrix to figure out which columns could be made friendlier using transforms. After this, I was able to create many graphs showing different patterns in the pricing and location of AirBnBs in NYC.
